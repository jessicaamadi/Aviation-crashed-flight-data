Aviation Crash Data Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes an aviation crash dataset containing over 2,000 records to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to aviation accidents. The analysis focuses on crash frequency, airlines involved, damage severity, locations, and fatalities using Excel data analysis techniques.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical data analysis skills such as data cleaning, summarization, PivotTable analysis, and interpretation of results.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:
	•	Crash Date – Date the crash occurred
	•	Aircraft Model / Type – Type of aircraft involved
	•	Aircraft Registration Code – Registration identifier
	•	Airline / Operator – Airline operating the aircraft
	•	Location – Where the crash occurred
	•	Damage Severity – Minor, Major, or Destroyed
	•	Fatalities – Number of deaths recorded

📊 Total records: 2,000+ aviation crash incidents

❓ Business Questions Answered
	1.	How many aviation crashes occurred each year?
	2.	Which airlines recorded the highest number of crashes?
	3.	Where do most aviation crashes occur?
	4.	Does the level of damage depend on the airline?
	5.	Are there specific aircraft models associated with higher fatality counts?

⸻

🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
	•	Microsoft Excel
	•	Data Cleaning
	•	Helper Columns (Year extraction)
	•	PivotTables
	•	Sorting & Filtering
	•	Charts (Bar & Line charts)

PivotTables were used to summarize large datasets efficiently instead of analyzing records individually.

⸻

🔍 Analysis Approach
	1.	Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring correct data types.
	2.	Created helper columns (e.g., Year from Crash Date).
	3.	Used PivotTables to:
	•	Group data by airline, year, location, and aircraft type.
	•	Count crash occurrences.
	•	Compare damage severity levels.
	4.	Sorted and filtered results to highlight key patterns.
	5.	Interpreted findings in a clear, non-biased manner.

⸻

📈 Key Insights
	•	Aviation crashes vary by year, showing periods of increase and decline.
	•	Some airlines appear more frequently in crash records.
	•	Certain locations experience higher crash occurrences.
	•	Damage severity differs across airlines.
	•	Some aircraft models are associated with higher fatality numbers.

(Detailed insights are available in the analysis file.)
